# FlashCards
This project is a test, in multiple ways. The literal portion is that this program runs in the terminal and is a flashcard game that outputs your score at the end. The deeper meaning to this project is that it was created utilizing the TDD method of programming and is fully tested.

## Setup

Clone down the forked repo (from your GitHub). Since you don't want to name your project "flashcards-starter", you can use an optional argument when you run `git clone` (you replace the `[...]` with the terminal command arguments):

```bash
git clone [remote-address] [what you want to name the repo]
```

Once you have cloned the repo, change into the directory and install the library dependencies. Run:

```bash
npm install
```

To verify that it is setup correctly, run `npm test` in your terminal. You should have 5 pending tests in your `Card` test file that show up.

Running `node index.js` from the root of your project should result in the following message being displayed in your terminal: 

```bash
Node server running on port 3000
```

*Note that you will not need to you run your server until you are instantiating your `Game` class in Iteration 3. Prior to that, you should be using TDD to drive your code. You should check the functionality of your application by running your tests via `npm test`.*



## Playing the Game
In the terminal, run:

```bash
node index.js
```

When the game is functioning appropriately, you will be prompted for each question, have the opportunity to select an answer, and will be given feedback. You will be able to play through the entire deck of cards:
